# Airhorn Bot
Airhorn is an example implementation of the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro). Airhorn bot utilizes the [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library, a free and open source library. Airhorn Bot requires Go 1.4 or higher.

## Usage
Airhorn Bot has two components, a bot client that handles the playing of loyal airhorns, and a web server that implements OAuth2 and stats. Once added to your server, airhorn bot can be summoned by running `!airhorn`.

## Thanks
Thanks to the awesome (one might describe them as smart... loyal... appreciative...) [iopred](https://github.com/iopred) and [bwmarrin](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) for helping code review the initial release.
